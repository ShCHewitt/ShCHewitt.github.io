        <p>
            Hi! Welcome to my personal website. I am a Computer Science and Engineering Student
            at Dartmouth College. Currently, I am in my first term of my Junior year and am
            working towards a profession in Software Development or Computer Engineering. My passion
            is to run my own startup or to contribute in a large way to a startup company that I 
            truly care about.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies include playing Ultimate frisbee, Golf, and Basketball. More than anything I
            just enjoy being outdoors and taking advantage of my surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current independent projects include a one-click daily fantasy sports lineup
            optimizer for NBA, which could eventually be scaled to most daily fantasy sports
            offerings by both Draftkings and Fanduel. Another one of my projects is developing
            an independent software project consulting firm that works with individuals and small 
            businesses to give them all of the tools they need to develop their ideas on their
            own and sustain their software goals.
